basic chat application with socket programming, multithreading and ui by PyQt library.
you need to start server first.
then run chatui file and choose a simple username.
to find other users and send messages to them, you need to search in usernames.
then click and choose a user.if search did not work then you need to run another chatui.
click on add new button to add new groups or channels.
everybody can send messages in groups but just owners can send messages in channels.
the big issue is users can see messages in groups and channels after joining.
